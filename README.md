Dynamic User Search UI
This project is a simple, modern user search interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates how to dynamically filter and display user profiles as you type into a search bar. The design features a sleek, dark aesthetic with blurred background effects for each user card.

‚ú® Features
Live Search Filter: Users are filtered in real-time as you type, providing an instant and responsive search experience.

Dynamic UI Generation: User cards are created and rendered dynamically from a JavaScript array, making the project easily scalable.

Aesthetic Design: The UI includes a blurred background effect that complements the main profile image, giving it a stylish and polished look.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
HTML: Structures the main page, including the search input and the container for the user cards.

CSS: Styles the UI, defining the layout, colors, and the unique card effects. Tailwind CSS is used to simplify the styling of the main layout.

JavaScript: Manages the core logic of the application, handling user data, generating the UI, and filtering the users based on the search input.

üöÄ How to Run
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory:

Bash

cd <project-folder>
Open index.html in your web browser:
Simply double-click the index.html file, or open it from your browser's file menu. The project runs entirely on the client side, so no server is needed.

‚úçÔ∏è Code Overview
index.html
This file sets up the basic structure of the page. It includes a single input field for searching and a div with the class cards where the user profiles will be displayed. It also links to the Tailwind CSS CDN and the local style.css and script.js files.

style.css
This file handles the visual design. Key styling includes:

A dark background for the body.

The .card class which sets up the container for each user.

The .blurred-layer class which creates the unique blurred background effect using a combination of filter: blur() and a mask-image to create a gradient-like fade.

script.js
This is where the main functionality resides.

A users array stores the data for each user, including their name, picture, and bio.

The showUsers function iterates through an array of users, creating and appending the necessary HTML elements (div, img, h3, p) to the DOM for each user.

An event listener is attached to the search input (.inp). Every time the input value changes, it filters the users array using the startsWith() method.

The content of the .cards container is cleared, and the showUsers function is called again with the filtered list of users, effectively updating the UI in real-time.

Analysis
SVG Archery Game
This is a dynamic archery game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features an interactive bow and arrow that you can control with your mouse to shoot at a moving target. The project utilizes GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for smooth, complex animations.

The user can click and drag the mouse to draw back the bow and aim. Releasing the mouse launches the arrow along a calculated path. The game detects hits on the target, including a special animation for a bullseye.

‚ú® Features
Interactive Controls: Click and drag to simulate drawing and releasing an arrow.

Realistic Physics (Animated): The arrow's trajectory is dynamically calculated, and its flight is animated along a curved path.

Hit Detection: The game accurately detects when the arrow intersects with the target.

Animated Feedback: Get visual feedback for a hit, a bullseye, or a miss with unique animated text overlays.

GSAP Integration: Uses the TweenMax and MorphSVGPlugin GSAP libraries for powerful and efficient SVG animations.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
HTML: Structures the game, defining the SVG elements for the bow, arrow, target, and other visual components.

CSS: Styles the overall look and feel, including the background and basic element appearance.

JavaScript: Manages all game logic, including mouse events, hit detection, arrow trajectory calculation, and triggering animations.

GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):

TweenMax: Used for handling all the animations, such as rotating the bow, moving the arrow, and scaling text.

MorphSVGPlugin: Used to animate the arrow's flight along a custom SVG path.

‚úçÔ∏è Code Overview
index.html
This file contains the main SVG markup for all game assets: the bow, the arrow (<use>), the target, and various text elements for "hit" or "miss" feedback. It also includes the GSAP library via CDN links.

style.css
A minimalist CSS file that sets a dark background and positions the SVG to fill the entire screen, giving it a clean, full-screen appearance.

script.js
This file contains the core game logic:

draw(e): Initializes the arrow draw action when the mouse is pressed.

aim(e): Calculates the angle and distance of the mouse from the bow's pivot point and updates the bow's visual state in real time.

loose(): Triggers when the mouse button is released, launching the arrow and initiating the animation along the defined path.

hitTest(tween): A function called on every animation frame to check for a collision between the arrow and the target line segment.

showMessage(selector): Handles the animation of the "hit," "bullseye," or "miss" text, scaling the letters into view.

getMouseSVG(e) and getIntersection(...): Helper functions for calculating mouse coordinates within the SVG and detecting line segment intersections.
